# Three tiers of computation in transformers and in brain architectures: *Supporting Code and Data*

Supporting code for generating the sentences from a context-free grammar, an indexed grammar, and a context-sensitive grammar in the folder **sentence-generation** and Dataset S1 (stats.csv) and Dataset S2 (stats_per_question.csv) in the folder **evaluations**, for the Supplemental Text of **Three tiers of computation in transformers and in brain architectures** by Emma Graham and Richard Granger.

> This code was run with Python 3.10.15 and with the packages *random*, *os*, *sys*, and *time* to run the **sentence-generation/main.py** file.
