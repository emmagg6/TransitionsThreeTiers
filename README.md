# Three tiers of computation in transformers and in brain architectures: *Supporting Code and Data*


Supporting code for generating the sentences from a context-free grammar, an indexed grammar, and a context-sensitive grammar in the folder **sentence-generation** and Dataset S1 (stats.csv) and Dataset S2 (stats_per_question.csv) in the folder **evaluations**, for the Supplemental Text of **Three tiers of computation in transformers and in brain architectures** by Emma Graham and Richard Granger.


> The **Three tiers of computation in transformers and in brain architectures** addresses evaluation and current approaches concerns discussed in [How AI can achieve human-level intelligence: researchers call for change in tack](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00649-4?utm_source=Live+Audience&utm_campaign=865f0cafd4-nature-briefing-daily-20250305&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_b27a691814-865f0cafd4-49902692)




*This code was run with Python 3.10.15 and with the packages* random, os, sys, *and* time *to run the **sentence-generation/main.py** file.*
